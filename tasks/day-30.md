## Checklist

### 1. Documentation index

- [ ] Single entry point (e.g. `docs/README.md` or wiki): architecture overview, service list, API docs link, env and config guide, runbook index. Keep links up to date.
- [ ] Runbook index: list all runbooks (deploy, rollback, backup restore, DLQ, incident, etc.) with one-line description and owner or team.

### 2. Onboarding

- [ ] Developer onboarding: how to clone, build, run locally (Docker Compose), run tests, and where to find API specs and task days. Prerequisites (Java, Maven, Docker, IDE).
- [ ] Ops onboarding: how to access staging/prod, where logs and dashboards live, how to deploy and rollback, who to escalate to.

### 3. Handoff and knowledge share

- [ ] Handoff doc or session: architecture decisions, known tech debt, roadmap or phase plan link. Record where secrets and config live and how to rotate.
- [ ] Optional: recording of walkthrough or architecture deep-dive for async onboarding.

### 4. Final review

- [ ] Review all task days (1–30) and phase plan; mark completed items; archive or update any obsolete sections. Ensure README and CONTRIBUTING reflect current process.
- [ ] Verify: new team member can follow onboarding and run system locally; ops can run one runbook successfully. Update Progress when done.
