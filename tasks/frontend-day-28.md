## Checklist

### 1. Richer visualizations

- [ ] Upgrade analytics views with clearer charts (line, bar, pie) for key LMS metrics (enrollments over time, completion rates, engagement).
- [ ] Ensure charts handle empty/low-data scenarios gracefully.

### 2. Filtering and comparison

- [ ] Add filters (course, cohort, date range) to analytics dashboards.
- [ ] Support simple comparisons (e.g. this month vs last month) where backend supports it.

### 3. Export and sharing

- [ ] Implement CSV export for at least one analytics view (e.g. enrollments or grades).
- [ ] Optionally support printable or PDF-friendly versions of key reports.

### 4. Tests and performance

- [ ] Add tests for analytics data fetching and export triggers.
- [ ] Verify dashboards remain responsive for larger datasets (consider pagination or aggregation).

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 28 is complete.
