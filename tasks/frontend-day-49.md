## Checklist

### 1. Demo and seed data UX

- [ ] Coordinate with backend or scripts to ensure demo data exists in staging (sample courses, users, enrollments).
- [ ] Provide simple instructions or quick links for UAT users to access relevant demo scenarios.

### 2. In-app tours and guidance

- [ ] Add a lightweight product tour or “getting started” hints for first-time users in staging.
- [ ] Ensure tours can be dismissed and re-opened without being intrusive.

### 3. Feedback loops

- [ ] Provide an in-app way to submit feedback or bug reports (e.g. link to form, feedback button).
- [ ] Capture environment, route, and user role context automatically where possible.

### 4. Documentation

- [ ] Document UAT flows and expectations: what to test, sample accounts, known limitations.
- [ ] Share this with stakeholders and keep it updated as features change.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 49 is complete.
