## Checklist

### 1. Control mapping

- [ ] Map controls (e.g. access control, encryption, logging, change management, incident response) to system capabilities: RBAC, TLS, audit logs, CI/CD, runbooks. Identify gaps and document remediation or compensating controls.
- [ ] Document where evidence lives: access reviews, backup logs, penetration test report, incident log.

### 2. Evidence and documentation

- [ ] Collect or automate evidence: access logs, change history (Git), deployment logs, backup verification, vulnerability scan results. Store in secure, auditable location; retention per certification requirement.
- [ ] Policy docs: security policy, incident response, backup and DR, acceptable use; review and version.

### 3. Gaps and remediation

- [ ] Prioritize gaps (e.g. MFA for admin, encryption at rest, log retention); create tickets and target dates. Document accepted risks and exceptions with approval.
- [ ] Schedule internal or external audit prep; rehearse evidence presentation.

### 4. Verify

- [ ] Control matrix and evidence index complete; at least one full evidence pull for a control. Update Progress when done.
