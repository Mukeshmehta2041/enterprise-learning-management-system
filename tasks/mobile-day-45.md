## Checklist

### 1. Motion guidelines

- [ ] Define simple guidelines for motion on mobile (durations, easing, and when to use haptics).
- [ ] Respect system “reduce motion” or haptic feedback preferences where possible.

### 2. Micro-interactions

- [ ] Add subtle animations for button presses, list item interactions, and state changes.
- [ ] Use haptic feedback sparingly for important actions (e.g. success, errors, key toggles).

### 3. Transitions

- [ ] Improve screen and modal transitions where it enhances perceived performance.
- [ ] Avoid excessive or long animations that slow down frequent tasks.

### 4. Testing

- [ ] Test animations and haptics on physical devices to validate feel.
- [ ] Confirm that critical information is not conveyed by motion or vibration alone.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 45 is complete.
