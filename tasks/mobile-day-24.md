## Checklist

### 1. Theme tokens and providers

- [ ] Define or refine mobile design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) in a central theme.
- [ ] Implement a theme provider/hooks to switch between light/dark and tenant-specific themes.

### 2. Dark mode support

- [ ] Respect system dark mode where appropriate, with an override toggle if desired.
- [ ] Verify core screens for legibility and contrast in both modes.

### 3. Institution branding

- [ ] Integrate tenant-specific logos, primary colors, and maybe accent elements based on user/tenant context.
- [ ] Provide safe fallbacks when branding is missing or misconfigured.

### 4. Testing

- [ ] Test theme switching on devices/emulators, including system theme changes at runtime.
- [ ] Update any stories or screenshots to show both modes.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 24 is complete.
