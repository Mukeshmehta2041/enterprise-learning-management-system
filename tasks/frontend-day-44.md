## Checklist

### 1. Responsive breakpoints and layout

- [ ] Confirm and document your responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- [ ] Audit main pages (auth, dashboard, course catalog, course view, assignments) for layout issues on small screens.

### 2. Navigation and touch targets

- [ ] Ensure navigation and tab bars work well on touch devices (adequate sizes, spacing).
- [ ] Fix any hover-only interactions that don’t translate to touch.

### 3. Tables and dense content

- [ ] Adapt wide tables and dashboards for small screens (stacked rows, horizontal scroll, or condensed views).
- [ ] Prioritize the most important information at smaller widths.

### 4. Verification

- [ ] Test on at least one real mobile device plus responsive mode in devtools.
- [ ] Capture before/after screenshots or notes for future design iteration.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 44 is complete.
