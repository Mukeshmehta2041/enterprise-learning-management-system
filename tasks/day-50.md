## Checklist

### 1. 50-day summary

- [ ] Document what was built across days 1–50: services, integrations, observability, security, and ops capabilities. List key deliverables (MVP, staging, prod, DR, compliance prep, etc.) and where evidence lives.
- [ ] Capture metrics: test coverage, number of runbooks, alerts, and docs; team velocity or lessons. Optional: publish internal “LMS backend 50-day summary” for stakeholders.

### 2. Architecture and docs refresh

- [ ] Update architecture diagram and service catalog to reflect current state (multi-tenant, read replicas, webhooks, etc.). Ensure phase plan shows completed phases and any new “Phase 6” or beyond.
- [ ] Review and prune obsolete task-day sections; add “Completed” or “Deferred” notes where useful. Ensure docs index and README point to single source of truth.

### 3. Roadmap and ownership

- [ ] Define next 30–90 day roadmap: new features, scale targets, certification timeline, or tech-debt sprints. Assign ownership for platform, security, and product-led initiatives.
- [ ] Schedule recurring reviews: backlog refinement, incident review, and dependency upgrade; document in runbook or team wiki.

### 4. Verify

- [ ] Summary and roadmap documented; architecture and phase plan updated. Team aligned on next priorities. Update Progress when done.
