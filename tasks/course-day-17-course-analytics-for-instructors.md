## Checklist

### Backend

- [ ] **Metrics definition**: Define which metrics to track (e.g. total watch time, average completion per lecture, drop-off points).
- [ ] **Aggregation jobs**: Implement jobs or queries that aggregate raw telemetry into analytics tables or views.
- [ ] **Analytics API**: Expose instructor-facing analytics endpoints scoped to their courses.

### Frontend

- [ ] **Instructor dashboard design**: Design and implement a basic analytics dashboard for instructors (tables/charts).
- [ ] **Lecture-level breakdown**: Show lecture-level metrics so instructors can see which content performs well or poorly.
- [ ] **Time range filters**: Add simple filters for time ranges (e.g. last 7/30/90 days) where supported by backend.

### Mobile

- [ ] **Compact analytics view**: Provide a compact, mobile-friendly view of key metrics for instructors.
- [ ] **Navigation entrypoint**: Add an entrypoint from instructor course views into the analytics screens on mobile.
- [ ] **Consistency with web**: Ensure numbers and definitions match web analytics views for the same data.
