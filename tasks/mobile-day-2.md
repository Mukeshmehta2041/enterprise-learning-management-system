## Checklist

### 1. React Navigation setup

- [ ] Install React Navigation (core, native stack, bottom tabs) and required peer dependencies.
- [ ] Create a navigation container at the app root.

### 2. Auth stack

- [ ] Implement `AuthStack` with `LoginScreen` and `RegisterScreen` placeholders.
- [ ] Show `AuthStack` when the user is not authenticated (temporary boolean flag is fine for now).

### 3. Main tabs and screens

- [ ] Implement `MainTabs` with at least `Home`, `Courses`, `Assignments`, and `Profile` tabs.
- [ ] Create placeholder screens for each tab and ensure tab icons/labels are wired up.
- [ ] Confirm navigation between tabs and back to auth works on both Android and iOS.

### 4. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Day 2 is complete.
