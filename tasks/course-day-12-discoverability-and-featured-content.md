## Checklist

### Backend

- [x] **Search filters**: Extend search/listing endpoints to support filters by tags, level, and featured status.

### Frontend

- [x] **Home experience**: Design and implement a home screen that highlights featured courses and relevant recommendations.
- [x] **Filterable course lists**: Add filters and chips for tags/levels on course listing pages.

### Mobile

- [x] **Featured carousels**: Add featured course carousels to the mobile home or discover tab.
- [x] **Mobile filters**: Provide simple tag/level filters in course lists adapted for small screens.
