## Checklist

### Backend

- [ ] **Featured flags**: Add fields and endpoints to mark courses and/or lectures as featured, trending, or recommended.
- [ ] **Tagging model**: Introduce tagging or categorization for courses (topics, level, language) and expose via APIs.
- [ ] **Search filters**: Extend search/listing endpoints to support filters by tags, level, and featured status.

### Frontend

- [ ] **Home experience**: Design and implement a home screen that highlights featured courses and relevant recommendations.
- [ ] **Filterable course lists**: Add filters and chips for tags/levels on course listing pages.
- [ ] **Search UX**: Improve search UI (typeahead, filters, empty states) to leverage backend capabilities.

### Mobile

- [ ] **Featured carousels**: Add featured course carousels to the mobile home or discover tab.
- [ ] **Mobile filters**: Provide simple tag/level filters in course lists adapted for small screens.
- [ ] **Search & results**: Ensure mobile search experience matches backend features and has clear empty/no-results states.
