## Checklist

### 1. Launch metrics

- [x] Gather metrics since launch: availability, error rate, p95/p99 latency, key business metrics (signups, enrollments, completions). Compare to pre-launch targets and baseline. Document in post-launch report.
- [x] Identify regressions or surprises; note what worked well (e.g. canary, feature flags).

### 2. Incidents and feedback

- [x] Review all incidents: root cause, detection time, resolution, runbook gaps. Update runbooks and add alerts or automation where needed. Capture lessons in blameless post-mortem format.
- [x] Collect feedback from support, sales, and users (performance, missing features, bugs); triage into backlog.

### 3. Backlog and roadmap

- [x] Build prioritized backlog: tech debt (from incidents or audits), performance improvements, feature requests, and compliance/certification follow-ups. Map to next phase or sprint; assign owners for critical items.
- [x] Update roadmap or phase plan with “Phase 6” or next milestones; share with stakeholders.

### 4. Verify

- [x] Post-launch report and backlog documented; at least one runbook or alert improved from incident. Update Progress when done.
