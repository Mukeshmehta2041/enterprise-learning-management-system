## Checklist

### 1. Form primitives and validation

- [ ] Confirm your form library approach (e.g. React Hook Form) for React Native.
- [ ] Implement reusable mobile form components (inputs, pickers, date/time, toggles) wired to validation.
- [ ] Standardize field error display and scrolling to first error for long forms.

### 2. Multi-step wizards

- [ ] Implement or refine at least one multi-step flow (e.g. onboarding wizard or course creation wizard on mobile).
- [ ] Preserve partially-entered data between steps and across short app pauses.

### 3. Mobile-specific resilience

- [ ] Handle keyboard interactions cleanly (avoid fields hidden behind keyboard, support `returnKeyType` navigation).
- [ ] Prevent multiple submissions via disabled buttons/spinners.

### 4. Tests and a11y

- [ ] Add tests for a complex form covering validation errors and success path.
- [ ] Make sure labels and accessibility hints are present for inputs and buttons.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 17 is complete.
