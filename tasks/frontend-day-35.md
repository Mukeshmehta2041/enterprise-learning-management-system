## Checklist

### 1. Token definition

- [ ] Define or refine design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, radii, and shadows.
- [ ] Store tokens in a central, tool-friendly format (e.g. TS/JSON, Tailwind config).

### 2. Component alignment

- [ ] Audit key components to ensure they use tokens instead of hard-coded values.
- [ ] Fix inconsistencies in spacing, font sizes, and colors across the app.

### 3. Dark mode / alternate themes (optional)

- [ ] Decide on support for dark mode or alternate themes via tokens.
- [ ] Implement a minimal second theme if part of your roadmap.

### 4. Documentation

- [ ] Document tokens and usage guidelines in your frontend or design docs.
- [ ] Add or update Storybook stories to showcase token usage and theming.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 35 is complete.
