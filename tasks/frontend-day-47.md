## Checklist

### 1. Scripts and tooling

- [ ] Audit existing npm/yarn/pnpm scripts for clarity and coverage (dev, test, lint, build, storybook, e2e).
- [ ] Add or refine scripts for common tasks (e.g. `dev:staging`, `test:watch`, `lint:fix`).

### 2. Code generation and scaffolding

- [ ] Consider simple generators for new features/pages/components (e.g. templates or CLI).
- [ ] Standardize file/folder structure enforced by generators where appropriate.

### 3. Editor and linting support

- [ ] Ensure ESLint/Prettier (or equivalents) are correctly configured for the frontend.
- [ ] Document recommended editor setup and extensions for contributors.

### 4. Documentation

- [ ] Update frontend docs to describe available scripts, dev workflows, and generators.
- [ ] Optionally add a short “DX tips” section for common troubleshooting.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 47 is complete.
