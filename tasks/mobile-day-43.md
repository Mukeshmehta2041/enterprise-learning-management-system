## Checklist

### 1. Navigation architecture review

- [ ] Review existing stacks, tabs, and nested navigators for clarity and consistency.
- [ ] Simplify or restructure navigation where it has become tangled or confusing.

### 2. Nested flows

- [ ] Ensure deep flows (e.g. dashboard → course → module → lesson → assignment) behave correctly with back navigation.
- [ ] Standardize how modals and full-screen dialogs are presented and dismissed.

### 3. State and params

- [ ] Confirm that route params are typed, validated, and resilient across app restarts and deep links.
- [ ] Avoid overloading routes with too many responsibilities; split screens where needed.

### 4. Verification

- [ ] Manually test navigation flows with both learners and instructors on devices.
- [ ] Add tests for at least one nested flow to prevent regressions.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 43 is complete.
