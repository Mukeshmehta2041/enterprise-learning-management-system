## Checklist

### 1. Metrics selection

- [ ] Decide on key mobile metrics: app starts, active users, crash rate, error rate, and key funnel completions.
- [ ] Confirm how these metrics are emitted (analytics SDK, crash reporting, custom events).

### 2. Dashboards

- [ ] Build or refine dashboards that visualize mobile metrics by platform, app version, and environment.
- [ ] Include panels for crash spikes, slow screens, and key journey completion rates.

### 3. Alerts and runbooks

- [ ] Add or refine alerts for critical mobile issues (e.g. crash rate spike, version-specific regressions).
- [ ] Link dashboards and alerts to runbooks that describe triage steps.

### 4. Verification

- [ ] Trigger sample events or test traffic in staging to validate dashboards and alerts.
- [ ] Share dashboard links with product and support teams as appropriate.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 48 is complete.
