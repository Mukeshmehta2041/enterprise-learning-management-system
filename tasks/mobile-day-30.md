## Checklist

### 1. Docs index and architecture

- [ ] Add or update a short “Mobile architecture overview” describing modules and key flows.

### 2. Examples and stories

- [ ] Document key components and patterns used in the mobile app (e.g. screens, common layouts, reusable widgets).
- [ ] If using a story/expo-style gallery, ensure it includes representative examples.

### 3. Developer onboarding

- [ ] Write or refine a “Getting started with the mobile app” guide: environment setup, running on devices, debugging, and testing.
- [ ] Include notes about how mobile integrates with backend and web (API gateway, shared models).

### 4. Verification

- [ ] Ask (or imagine) a new dev following the docs end-to-end and fix confusing gaps.
- [ ] Link mobile docs from the root docs index or main `README` for discoverability.

### 5. Progress update
