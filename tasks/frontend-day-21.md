## Checklist

### 1. Privacy center entry point

- [ ] Add a “Privacy & Settings” or similar entry point from the profile/account area.
- [ ] Clearly explain what users can control here (email preferences, data exports, tracking, etc.).

### 2. Communication and notification preferences

- [ ] Provide toggles for marketing emails, product updates, and course-related notifications (as supported by backend).
- [ ] Ensure these settings are persisted via appropriate APIs and reflected in the UI.

### 3. Data and tracking controls

- [ ] Surface options for analytics/tracking consent where required (cookie banner or preferences panel).
- [ ] Link to privacy policy and terms of service in relevant locations.

### 4. Data subject actions (UI only)

- [ ] Add UI hooks for data subject requests (e.g. “Request data export”, “Request account deletion”) that call or queue backend workflows.
- [ ] Show clear confirmation and timelines (e.g. “We’ll process this within X days”) where applicable.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 21 is complete.
