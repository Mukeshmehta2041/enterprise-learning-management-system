## Checklist

### 1. Motion guidelines

- [ ] Define simple guidelines for motion (durations, easing, where to use/avoid animation).
- [ ] Respect user preferences for reduced motion where possible.

### 2. Micro-interactions

- [ ] Add subtle animations for hover/focus states, button presses, and list item selection.
- [ ] Animate transitions for modals, drawers, and toasts to improve perceived quality.

### 3. Page and layout transitions

- [ ] Optionally add light transitions between major routes (e.g. fade or slide) while keeping navigation snappy.
- [ ] Avoid long or heavy animations that slow down frequent workflows.

### 4. Verification

- [ ] Test animations on low-power devices and with “prefers-reduced-motion” enabled.
- [ ] Ensure no critical information is conveyed by motion alone.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 45 is complete.
