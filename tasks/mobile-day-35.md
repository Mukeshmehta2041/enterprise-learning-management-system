## Checklist

### 1. Token catalog

- [ ] Define or refine tokens for spacing, typography, colors, radii, and elevations on mobile.
- [ ] Store tokens in a reusable module or theme file used across screens.

### 2. Component alignment

- [ ] Audit heavily used mobile components and ensure they pull from tokens, not hard-coded values.
- [ ] Fix inconsistencies in spacing and font usage across major screens.

### 3. Theming support

- [ ] Ensure tokens and themes can support light/dark and tenant variations added previously.
- [ ] Add helpers or types to make token usage ergonomic and safe.

### 4. Documentation

- [ ] Document tokens and how to use them in mobile components.
- [ ] Add a few example screens or component docs demonstrating correct usage.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 35 is complete.
