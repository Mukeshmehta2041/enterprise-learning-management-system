## Checklist

### 1. Instructor dashboard

- [ ] Create or refine a mobile instructor dashboard showing key metrics (active courses, enrollments, upcoming deadlines).
- [ ] Add shortcuts to common actions (create course, view submissions, send announcements).

### 2. Admin dashboard (if applicable)

- [ ] Provide a minimal admin dashboard for mobile use (e.g. user counts, system status, high-level alerts).
- [ ] Link out to more detailed web-based admin tools where needed.

### 3. Navigation and role awareness

- [ ] Integrate dashboards into the navigation for users with corresponding roles.
- [ ] Ensure dashboards are hidden or replaced for learner-only users.

### 4. Testing and UX

- [ ] Add tests or manual checklists for dashboard data and navigation.
- [ ] Validate that dashboards remain usable on small screens with limited space.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 41 is complete.
