## Checklist

### 1. Metrics selection

- [ ] Decide on key frontend metrics: page load, core web vitals, error rates, and important funnel steps.
- [ ] Confirm how these metrics are emitted (frontend SDK, RUM, custom events).

### 2. Dashboards

- [ ] Create or refine dashboards in your observability tool showing these metrics per environment.
- [ ] Add panels for error spikes, slow pages, and drop-offs in key flows (login, enrollment, course completion).

### 3. Alerts and runbooks

- [ ] Add or refine alerts for critical frontend issues (e.g. error rate spike, severe performance regression).
- [ ] Link dashboards and alerts to relevant runbooks for incident response.

### 4. Verification

- [ ] Trigger sample events in staging or dev to validate dashboards and alerts.
- [ ] Share dashboard links in team docs or chat for easy access.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 48 is complete.
