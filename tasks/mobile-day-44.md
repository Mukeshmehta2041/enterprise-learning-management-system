## Checklist

### 1. Layout breakpoints

- [ ] Define how the app should adapt to small vs large screens (phone vs tablet).
- [ ] Implement responsive layout patterns (e.g. side-by-side panes on tablets, single column on phones).

### 2. Orientation and rotation

- [ ] Decide which screens support rotation and which are locked (e.g. content player).
- [ ] Test rotations on both platforms to avoid broken layouts.

### 3. Input and controls

- [ ] Ensure spacing and control sizes feel appropriate on larger screens (not too cramped or sparse).
- [ ] Adjust list densities and card sizes for tablet use where it improves readability.

### 4. Verification

- [ ] Test on at least one small phone and one tablet (or emulator equivalents).
- [ ] Capture any follow-up tasks where more sophisticated tablet UX is desired.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 44 is complete.
