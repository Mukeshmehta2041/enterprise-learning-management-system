## Checklist

### 1. Authoring entry points

- [ ] Ensure instructors have a clear “Teaching” or “Authoring” area in the navigation.
- [ ] Provide entry points for creating new courses, modules, and assignments from this area.

### 2. Course and module management

- [ ] Implement or refine UI for adding, editing, reordering, and deleting modules/lessons.
- [ ] Support draft vs published states and indicate status clearly in the UI.
- [ ] Confirm that changes are autosaved or clearly saved with feedback.

### 3. Assignment authoring

- [ ] Provide forms for creating and editing assignments (title, description, due date, grading scheme, attachments).
- [ ] Show how assignments map to modules/courses and let instructors easily navigate between them.

### 4. Workflow clarity

- [ ] Add guidance text or helper tooltips to explain next steps (e.g. “Publish course to make it visible to learners”).
- [ ] Surface validation errors and backend failures with the global error/toast patterns from earlier days.

### 5. Tests and UX review

- [ ] Add tests for at least one instructor flow (e.g. create course + first module + first lesson).
- [ ] Perform a manual walkthrough as an instructor and adjust UX copy or layout for clarity.

### 6. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 19 is complete.
