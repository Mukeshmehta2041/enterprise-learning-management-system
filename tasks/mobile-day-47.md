## Checklist

### 1. Scripts and automation

- [ ] Audit existing npm/yarn scripts for mobile (start, build, test, e2e).
- [ ] Add or refine scripts for common tasks (e.g. `ios`, `android`, `lint`, `test:watch`, `e2e`).

### 2. Dev menu and helpers

- [ ] Configure or enhance dev menu options (e.g. toggle API env, clear storage, show debug info).
- [ ] Add simple in-app debug screen or overlay (dev-only) exposing useful diagnostics.

### 3. Debugging tooling

- [ ] Ensure Flipper or equivalent tooling is working well for network, logs, and performance.
- [ ] Document how to attach debuggers and inspect app state.

### 4. Documentation

- [ ] Update mobile docs to describe available scripts, dev workflows, and debugging techniques.
- [ ] Optionally add “troubleshooting” tips for common simulator/device issues.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Mobile Day 47 is complete.
