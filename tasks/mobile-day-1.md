## Checklist

### 1. Project bootstrap

- [ ] Create a React Native project (CLI or Expo) with TypeScript support.
- [ ] Organize folders: `src/`, `src/screens`, `src/navigation`, `src/components`, `src/api`, `src/state`.
- [ ] Verify the app runs on at least one platform (Android emulator or iOS simulator/device).

### 2. Tooling and quality

- [ ] Enable TypeScript with a sensible `tsconfig.json` for React Native.
- [ ] Add ESLint with React/TypeScript/React Native rules and a basic rule set.
- [ ] Add Prettier and ensure it works with your editor or via script.
- [ ] Add Jest and React Native Testing Library; write a simple test for a sample component.

### 3. Sample screen and navigation placeholder

- [ ] Create a basic `HomeScreen` that renders some placeholder text.
- [ ] Wire the screen into a minimal navigation container (even before full navigation setup).

### 4. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Day 1 is complete.
