## Checklist

### 1. Project bootstrap

- [x] Create a React Native project (CLI or Expo) with TypeScript support.
- [x] Organize folders: `src/`, `src/screens`, `src/navigation`, `src/components`, `src/api`, `src/state`.
- [x] Verify the app runs on at least one platform (Android emulator or iOS simulator/device).

### 2. Tooling and quality

- [x] Enable TypeScript with a sensible `tsconfig.json` for React Native.
- [x] Add ESLint with React/TypeScript/React Native rules and a basic rule set.
- [x] Add Prettier and ensure it works with your editor or via script.
- [x] Add Jest and React Native Testing Library; write a simple test for a sample component.
- [x] Set up NativeWind for Tailwind CSS styling in mobile.

### 3. Sample screen and navigation placeholder

- [x] Create a basic `HomeScreen` that renders some placeholder text.
- [x] Wire the screen into a minimal navigation container (even before full navigation setup).

### 4. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Day 1 is complete.
