## Checklist

### 1. Identify and prioritize debt

- [ ] Review TODO/FIXME comments, lint warnings, and known pain points in the frontend.
- [ ] Choose a small set of high-impact items to tackle (duplication, brittle code, confusing patterns).

### 2. Refactor safely

- [ ] Refactor targeted components or hooks to clearer patterns, smaller units, or better abstractions.
- [ ] Maintain or improve test coverage where refactors touch critical logic.

### 3. Remove dead code

- [ ] Delete unused components, hooks, and utilities.
- [ ] Update imports and references to avoid drift.

### 4. Document remaining debt

- [ ] Capture remaining significant tech debt in an issue tracker or doc with context and priority.
- [ ] Note guidance for future contributors to avoid reintroducing solved issues.

### 5. Progress update

- [ ] Update the **Progress** table at the top of this file when Frontend Day 46 is complete.
